# ft_printf
## About

This project is about recoding the famous printf C function to learn variadic functions and improve algorithmic methodology.

| **Program name**     | libftprintf.a                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Turn in files**    | *.c, */*.c, *.h, */*.h, Makefile                             |
| **Makefile**         | all, clean, fclean, re                                       |
| **External functs**  | malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end       |
| **Libft authorized** | yes                                                          |
| **Description**      | Write a library that contains ft_printf, a function that will mimic the real printf |

## Usage

You can try our project with the following commands:

First, clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lgaultie/ft_printf
cd ft_printf
make
```

then compile your file with the generated **libftprintf.a** by adding in the main

```c
#include "src/ft_printf.h"
```
